# RedditCommentTextClassification

**Remember to download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/reddit-comment-classification-comp-551/data) and place both the training and testing file in the data/raw_data directory**

The whole data folder has been added in the .gitignore so this should not be an issue, but please do not push any of the large csv file here.
